IFI Life Support Mod Parts Expansion by Akinesis:

Additional parts for Interstellar Flight Inc. - Kerbal Life Support (IFILS) Mod by Stavell. The items included in this addition were orignally designed by zzz, so all credit goes to him for all modelling and texturing. I have simply modified his work to be compatible with Stavells' IFILS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:


-To install, merge the GameData folder within this pack to KSPs GameData folder.
-If you have Kerbal Attachment System installed, the optional folder allows the small and medium Life Support containers to behave like KAS modules. Drop the 'GameData' folder from the 'Optional_KAS' into your KSP save and overwrite any Folders and Files if you want to use this function.
